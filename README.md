# FinalC#Project
The program is a simple account creation/login with a webscraper attached to it, the webscraper will have a set list of sites to choose to scrape from and there will be a search bar to allow the user to input data that they want from the specific site of their choosing.
The scraper will have an account history feature, displaying a grid of everything that was searched in the search bar and each field can be deleted to the user's liking.
There is a sign up and login page that allows accounts to be created and accessed respectively and
an account must be made in order to access the scraper.
There is also a produce report button that will import all scraped data from a website into a text file into its own folder (located in the same file as the program)
It has an exit button that can allow the user to close the program anytime they want, and a back button (only accesible in the scraper) that will log them out of their account and take them back to the login/sign up screen.
This program uses sqlite databases to ensure that the program runs correctly and efficiently.
Uses 3 different extension packages.
Made in C#.
